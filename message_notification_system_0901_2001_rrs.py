Message Notification System using Scrapy
=====================================

This is a simple Scrapy-based message notification system. It's designed to be
flexible and extensible, allowing for easy integration with various notification
services and APIs.

To use this system, you'll need to configure the Scrapy settings file (settings.py)
with the necessary configuration options, such as the API key and the list of start URLs.

Attributes:
    enabled (bool): Whether the message notification system is enabled.
    api_key (str): The API key for the notification service.

Methods:
    parse(response): Handles the response from the start URLs and sends notifications.
    parse_item(response, item): Processes each item and potentially sends notifications.

Example Usage:
    >>> run_spider()
    This will start the crawling process and send notifications based on the configured settings.

Note:
    This is a basic implementation and may require additional error handling and configuration
    depending on the specific requirements of your notification system.
