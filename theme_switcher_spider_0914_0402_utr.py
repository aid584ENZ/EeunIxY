A Scrapy Spider that demonstrates a theme switching feature.
This spider can switch between different themes by setting the theme
in its settings, and it will yield items with the theme information.

# Note:
# - You need to replace 'http://example.com' with the actual URL you want to scrape.
# - You need to adjust the CSS selectors according to the actual structure of the website.
# - The 'allowed_domains' and 'start_urls' should be set accordingly.
# - The 'ThemeItem' class should be adjusted to include the fields you want to scrape.
# - This spider assumes that the theme is set either in the settings.py file or as an argument when running the spider.
# - Error handling is included to ensure that a theme is configured before starting the spider.
